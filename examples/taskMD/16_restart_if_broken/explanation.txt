new: MDrestart_if_broken    1

CAST tests after every MD step if all bonds are still intact, i.e. if the bond length of every bond is reasonable.
If this option is set to 1 after recognising broken bonds the coordinates of all atoms are set to the original coordinates at the beginning of 
the simulation and new random velocities are assigned (according to the currently desired temperature, i.\,e. if you've applied a gradient the gradient 
won't start again but the temperature will continue to act how you would expect it if the simulation had run normally). 
You can see when such a thing happens in the output ("output.txt") so in our case it happens the first time between 900 and 1000 steps. In the
file "restart_if_broken_MD_TRACE.txt" you can see the temperature continues to raise like it's expected. If you watch the simulation with VMD
you can clearly see how the structure jumps back to the original coordinates between the snapshots 198 and 199 (for example, of course it happens much more
often)
