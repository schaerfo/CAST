MDheat                 3000     100

simulation starts with 50K,
keeps temperature constant till 1000 steps, 
then rises it linearly to 300K at 2000 steps,
back to 100K at 3000 steps
and keeps it constant at 100K till the end of the simulation
(see file heating_without_thermostat_MD_TRACE.txt)

all of this is done by direct velocity scaling
