Periodicp              1

With the first line you switch on periodic boundaries, i.e. the inputstructure is taken as a unit cell and virtually multiplied in any direction in order to
create an infinite system. As a consequence every molecule that leaves the box enters it again at the opposite site of the box (you can see this when
watching the simulation in VMD).
The first number is 1 for switching periodic boundaries on and 0 for switching them off. The following three numbers determine the size of the box
(in x-, y- and z-direction) in angstrom.

If you set the option Periodicp to 1 (like it is here) dummy atoms are printed in the corners of the periodic box in every snapshot (you can see them 
in VMD, too).
