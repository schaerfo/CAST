applies the rattle algorithm to all bonds that contain an H-atom
this means the bond length of all bonds with an H is kept constant at an ideal value during the simulation

set MDrattle to 1 instead of 0 to switch on rattle constraint (another possible value is 2, see next example)
MDrattpar determines the file where the ideal bond length is taken from (e.g. the same parameter file as above)
