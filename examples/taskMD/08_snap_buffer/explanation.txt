MDsnap_buffer          100

number of snapshots that are saved before they are written into file

see: snap_buffer_MD_SNAP_break.arc
consists of 199 snapshots (actually 200 because first snapshot is file before simulation starts)
if simulation was broken at other points, number of snapshots would be 99, 199, 299,...
