These lines do a pressure control via Behrendsen barostat in order to create an NPT ensemble. It is important to know that it is only possible to use 
pressure control if periodic boundaries are activated because the pressure control is done by modification of the periodic box size. You can see this 
in VMD if you plot the distance between two of the box atoms against the simulation timestep.

The first line just switches on the barostat (0 would switch it off). The MDptarget option gives the target pressure in atmosphere, so in our case it is
1 atm. You can see the current pressure in the file "press_MD_TRACE.txt" in the third column. The values are quite far from the target pressure and 
variy quite strongly. However it is comparable to the results of a tinker calculation performed with similar parameters (see "output_tinker.txt").

MDpcompress is the isothermal compressibility of the substance (the default value 0.000046 is for water) and MDpdelay barostat delay in picoseconds. 
It is needed to calculate the scaling factor for the box. When in doubt, just leave the default value of 2.0ps.
