Inputfile needs:
- general information (verbosity, name of structure file, type of structure file, energy interface, name of forcefield parameter file)
- task: MD (molecular dynamics)
- cutoff (maximum distance where non-bonding energy terms are calculated)
- MD options:
  * number of MD steps
  * integrator (Velocity-Verlet of Beeman)
  * timestep (time of one MD-step)
  * track: activate tracking (should normally be switched on)
  * MDsnap: number of snapshots (here: 50000)

Output:
- without_all_MD_TRACE.txt: table with timestep, temperature, pressure (not calculated), kinetic, potential, total energy and snapshot number
- without_all_MD_SNP.txt: file with all structures that are snapshots, can be viewed in VMD
