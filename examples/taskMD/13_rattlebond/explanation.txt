MDrattlebond           2  0
MDrattlebond           5  1

if MDrattle is set to 2 only specified bonds are constrained 
the bonds that are constrained are given by MDrattlebond
every line contains the 2 atom numbers for the bond (starting with 0, i.e. always the number in the tinkerstructure -1)
the first number has to be the number of the H-atom

in this case the O-H-bond and one of the C-H-bonds are constrained whereas the other two C-H-bonds move normally
(see rattlebond_MD_SNAP.arc and the diagram bondlengths.png)
