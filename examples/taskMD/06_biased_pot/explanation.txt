applies an additional potential to every atom which depends on the distance of the active site
active site is calculated as geometrical center of all atoms given by MDactive_site (atom numbers = first line in tinker structure file)

if the distance is smaller than the inner cutoff (first number in MDcutoff) -> "normal" movement
if the distance is bigger than the outer cutoff (second number in MDcutoff) -> no movement
between those extremes -> gradual scaling of velocity

MDbiased_potential -> switches biased potential on and off

MDadjust_by step:
0 -> active site and distances are calculated only once in initialisation of simulation
1 -> active site and distances are calculated new for every step

compare not_adjust_MD_SNAP.arc and adjust_MD_SNAP.arc (differ only in this last option)
active site is defined as the NH3-group of an argine
not-adjust: phenyl-ring of phenylalanin that is around 10 angström from active site (at the beginning) moves slowly the whole time
adjust: the same phenyl-ring moves a lot when arginine bends towards it and not at all when arginine bends in the other direction

DO NOT USE NOSE-HOOVER THERMOSTAT WITH BIASED POTENTIAL!!! (direct velocity scaling is ok)
better do not use veloscale (because is doesn't make sense)
