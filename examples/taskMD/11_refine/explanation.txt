new:
MDrefine_offset        5000

builds every 5000 steps new non-bonded matrix (see output.txt)

As the atoms and bonds should stay the same during a MD simulation, 
I guess it is only of use if there is a cutoff radius because the distances between atoms change during the simulation
and so the pairs between which the non-bonded interaction is calculated might also change.

NEW since 12.01.2017 !!!
Always set this option to 0 because refinement only makes sense with the linked cell algorithm that is currently deactivated.
