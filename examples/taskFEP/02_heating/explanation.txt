new: a temperature gradient is applied
MDheat                 0   0.1
MDheat                 500 300

This is only relevant for the initialisation run. So during the first 500 steps the temperature is gradually raised from 0.1 to 300K.
After that the temperature is kept constant at 300K for the rest of the FEP run (see fep_heating_MD_TRACE.txt)
