This is an example to show the reason for the use of a softcore potential. Here the free energy for a mutation in the protein ubiquitin is calculated and
the softcore potential is switched off (FEPvshift = 0.0 and FEPcshift = 0.0).

If you look at the file "alchemical.txt" you see that for the runs where lambda = 0 and dlamda = 0.1 the energies do fluctuate very strongly.
The reason is that the conformation is found by simulating the molecule with lambda = 0 which means that the atoms that are appearing during the mutation
are not taken into account. So there is nothing to prevent them from crashing with other atoms. However for the calculation of the free energies the 
potential energy for the conformation with lamda = 0.1 where these atoms are (partly) present is also taken into account. Since the potential energy 
function has a singularity at r=0 it gets very big if atoms are crashing and that's the reason for the big fluctuations that have a bad influence on the 
calculation of the free energy.

Another thing that might happen is the explosion of the molecule when the appearing atoms are finally switched on for the conformational search 
(i.e. in the equilibration of the next step).

To avoid these things it is recommended to use a softcore potential that has no singularity at r = 0 instead of the normal Lennard-Jones Potential.
It is not so important to use a softcore potential for the electrostatic interactions because they are normally switched on later (by FEPeleccouple)
when the van der Waals interactions already prevent the atoms from crashing.
