In the last example you saw that it is a good idea to use a softcore potential in order to avoid simulation instabilities.
This example now shows you that too much softcore is also not a good idea.

The only thing that changed in comparison to the last example is the following line:
FEPvshift      100.0
So now there is a very strong shift in the Van der Waals potential.

This causes the simulation to break. (see alchemical.txt, FEP_Results.txt, no_softcore_MD_TRACE.txt or the console output)
The reason for this can be understood if you look at the softcore potentials for different FEPvshift values (softcore_vdw.png).
For small values (green and blue) the potential keeps more or less the original form of the Lennard Jones potential but just without the singularity.
For bigger values (red and orange) there is no minimum but the lowest energy distance is zero. So as a consequence it is not only not avoided that atoms 
crash but they are even forced to do so. And in the next window when the softcore potential approximates the "normal" potential better this can be the 
reason for the program to break.

So you should always choose a sensible value for FEPvshift. If you see the warning "WARNING! You should choose a smaller value for vshift!" 
(see screenshot.png) this is a sign that the value is too large and the softcore potential for your smallest lambda has no minimum anymore.
